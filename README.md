# Mask R-CNN for pigs Detection and Segmentation

This is an implementation of Mask R-CNN for pigs detection and segmentation.

It is based on the [library](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN) and pipeline from the [repository](https://github.com/divyahanda219/DH_Project/tree/master), the creators of which trained the network to detect and segment pigs. The library has been modified for compatibility with Tensorflow version >2.
